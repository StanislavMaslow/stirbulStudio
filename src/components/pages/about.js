                    <p><strong>Architectural</strong><br />We have extensive experience of new build and renovation work
                        at both domestic and commercial levels.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interior Planning</strong><br />We consider the building as a whole and feel that in
                        order to maintain a clear concept running through the whole project, the exterior and interior
                        should be considered as one. &nbsp;Through this thinking we have a great deal of experience
                        in&nbsp;interior&nbsp;design and remodelling.</p>
                    <p><strong>Planning Applications</strong><br />We currently have a 100% success rate with obtaining
                        planning permission, and have experience in both urban and sensitive rural sites.</p>
                    <p><strong>Furniture and Product Design</strong><br />We have had a number of clients that have
                        wanted specifically designed furniture and other items. This ranges from staircases to chairs
                        and tables.</p>
                    <p><strong>Graphic Design</strong><br />We work in close association with graphic designers and have
                        undertaken a number of combined graphic branding appointments that draw on and inform the
                        architecture of the final project.</p>
                    <p><strong>Landscape Design</strong></p>
                    <p>We work closely with several modern landscape design companies and together strive to create
                        synergy and harmony between a building and its environment.</p>
                    <p><strong>3D Visualisation and Animated Presentations</strong><br />We have found that clients
                        often have difficulty visualising our ideas from standard two dimensional line drawings. For
                        this reason we employ the latest in modern computer generated visualisation technology. This
                        allows the Client to pre-experience the design in the most real fashion.</p>
